# ForgeLife

So since I didn't include a readme in the local copy here is a basic one. 
You click the Hut(it's supposed to be a forge). You get money. As you get more money you buy wierd buildings/technologies on the right.
Every building you buy earns you more $$ per/second. The game persists while you are away earning you gajillions.
